# Efficient-Prime-Generator
Generate Prime numbers upto a given number using [`sieve of eratosthenes algorithm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Algorithm_and_variants).

## Usage
Compile `main.c` with `gcc` as `gcc main.c -o filename` on linux or `gcc main.c -o filename.exe` on windows.
Then, `./filename` on linux or `filename` on windows.

#### Remarks
This script was able to generate prime numbers upto 100000000 or 10‚Å∏. 99999989 being the last prime. Creating a file of 51099000 bytes or 51.1 MB in a time span of less than 10 seconds which is more than a 1000 times faster than the [previous script](https://github.com/krishna2803/prime-number-generator).
